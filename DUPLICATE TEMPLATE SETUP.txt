Step 1: Copy and rename the folder

Find your existing project folder on your computer
Copy the entire folder (Ctrl+C or right-click → Copy)
Paste it wherever you want
Rename the copied folder (e.g., my-new-project)


Step 2: Clean up the copied folder
Open the renamed folder and:

Delete the .git folder (removes connection to old repo)

Show hidden files first:

Windows: View → Show → Hidden items
Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + .


Find and delete the .git folder


Delete node_modules folder (optional, saves space)
Update package.json (optional but recommended):

json   {
     "name": "my-new-project",  // Change this
     "version": "1.0.0"
   }
Step 3: Create new GitHub repository

Go to github.com
Click "+" (top right) → "New repository"
Name it (same as your folder name is easiest)
Don't check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, nothing)
Click "Create repository"


Step 4: Connect and push to new repo
Open terminal/command prompt in your new project folder and run:


git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/rodget109/YOUR-NEW-REPO-NAME.git
git push -u origin main
